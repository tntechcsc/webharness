This project would entail development of a demonstration harness, controllable from a web interface. This harness would be capable of handling launching of different applications (e.g. java applications, AR/VR applications, python scripts, etc.) on the host machine (stretch goal: from other, networked machines). The web interface would be a locally hosted web page/site, and would be extensible to add/remove applications ad hoc.
